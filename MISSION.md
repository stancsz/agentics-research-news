### Reflections on Karpathy

> *Placeholder for your notes/reflections as you study each resource.*

#### Reflection 1: [After watching "Zero to Hero" playlist]
*Pending...*

#### Reflection 2: [After cloning and reading llm.c]
**WOW.** This is the most clarifying thing I've read on how LLMs actually work.

The key insight: a GPT model is STRIKINGLY simple. It's just a sequence of indices that goes through a Transformer, and a probability distribution over the next index comes out. The complexity everyone obsesses over (batching, efficiency, CUDA kernels) is NOT the model itself — it's just making it fast.

Reading `train_gpt2.c` in ~1000 clean lines of C:
- Every layer has a forward and backward pass implemented manually
- No autograd, no PyTorch — just raw `float*` pointers and math
- LayerNorm: normalize → scale → shift. That's it.
- Attention: QKV projections → softmax(QK^T/sqrt(d)) @ V → projection

The philosophical point Karpathy makes is important: we're training 124M+ param models with almost no code. The "magic" is the architecture + data + compute, not complex software.

**Key takeaway:** If you want to understand LLMs, read minGPT first (~300 lines, PyTorch). Then read llm.c to see it stripped of all abstraction. You'll understand more after this than after months of prompting.

#### Reflection 3: [After minGPT study]
minGPT is beautifully documented. The README traces GPT-1 → GPT-2 → GPT-3 evolution with actual paper details (learning rates, layer counts, initialization strategies).

Mind-blowing detail: GPT-3 175B uses a context window of 2048 tokens, warmup over 375M tokens, and cosine decay. The smaller models (GPT-2 124M) use only 1024 context. The scaling is systematic and deliberate.

## Study Log

### 2026-04-17: minGPT + llm.c Deep Dive

**minGPT Architecture (~300 lines)**
- Clean 3-file structure: `model.py`, `bpe.py`, `trainer.py`
- GPT model is just a Transformer decoder: sequence of tokens → probability distribution over next index
- Key insight: most complexity is batching efficiency, not the model itself
- CausalSelfAttention: QKV projections → split heads → attention with causal mask
- GPT-2 config options: 124M, 350M, 774M, 1558M parameters

**llm.c Philosophy**
- Goal: train LLMs WITHOUT PyTorch's 245MB overhead
- `train_gpt2.c` ~1000 lines = complete GPT-2 training in clean C
- Every layer (encoder, layernorm, attention, MLP) implemented from scratch with forward + backward passes
- Interesting: uses raw `float*` buffers, manual softmax, manual matmul
- Notable forks: Rust, Go, C#, Mojo, Zig, Metal, WebGPU, AMD, Habana Gaudi2

## Progress Update: 2026-04-18

### nanoGPT Study (Successor to minGPT)

**nanoGPT** is karpathy's rewrite of minGPT that "prioritizes teeth over education." Key findings:

- **330 lines** (`model.py`) for the complete GPT definition
- **336 lines** (`train.py`) for the training loop
- Supports **Flash Attention** (PyTorch >= 2.0) for efficient CUDA kernels
- Can load **GPT-2 weights directly from OpenAI** via HuggingFace
- Reproduces GPT-2 124M on OpenWebText in ~4 days on single 8XA100 40GB node
- Ships with **Shakespeare** as a quick-start dataset (1MB, trains in ~3 min on A100)
- The `config/` dir has ready-to-use configs for different model sizes
- Also includes `scaling_laws.ipynb` and `transformer_sizing.ipynb` for deep dives

**Architecture comparison:**

| Repo | Lines | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| minGPT | ~300 | Educational, clean |
| nanoGPT | ~330 + 336 | Teeth, reproducibility |
| llm.c | ~1000 | No dependencies, pure C |

**nanoGPT is the recommended starting point now** - minGPT is "semi-archived."

### Cloned Repos (Complete List)
```
✅ karpathy/llm.c        - Pure C LLM implementation
✅ karpathy/minGPT       - Minimal PyTorch GPT (educational)
